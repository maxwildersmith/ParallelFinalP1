This is a Java project that demonstrates interprocess communication in the form of a 3-way Rock Paper Scissors game. 
To run, launch 3 instances of the Player class, **then** answer the prompt for each instance. If it is done properly it after answering each
prompt the program should register a new player has signalled for a start.
